Examine this weeks tutorial code for an example of how to implement the GBA's DMA controller and set up some functionality to implement fast copying of data from one location to another. This weeks tutorial also includes an example of how to use the HBlank interrupt with DMA to change the colour of the screen on clear.

The extension work for this tutorial is to introduce and produce code capable of setting up and using the inbuilt timers that are available to the GBA. These timers can be used to monitor the performance of of specific areas of code as well as to provide timing data for other functionality that may be used by games produced for the GBA. Whilst most game timers will be based off the screen refresh rate and the period of the VBlank within hardware additional timers can be used by the GBA with different timing specifications.
