Some of this tutorial will be covered in class this session. There is an attached document that outlines what is to be created as part of this weeks tutorial session. Follow along with this document and the in class session to create an implementation of a memory pool that could be used to reduce the number of calls to new and delete on items that may be frequently moving in and out of memory.
